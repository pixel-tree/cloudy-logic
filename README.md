# CLOUDY LOGIC: AN ABSURD TALE IN THE CLOUD

A browser-based multi-user dimension. URL: *cloudylogic.space*.

### Context

Cloudy Logic essay. Adorno. Postmodernism. Representationalism to performativity. Neural nets. Abstract authority - dressing up superstitions in empirical terms to make them seem more credible. Tension between different logics in AI development - business and technical / the expectation vs reality - design and appearance are magic tricks to divert attention from flaws and limitations - enveloping the world / developing space for technology rather than vice versa. Yada yada.

### Implementation

Prototypes:
1. Local/terminal
2. Discord
3. Browser

Current version: a hybrid of terminal and browser.

Combining some social aspects of a classical MUD / users using a shared virtual machine; but with elements of performance that emerge from the interplay between players, NPCs, and the complex ecosystem as a whole.

If you wish to implement a version of this yourself, please refer to *requirements.txt* for a detailed list of libraries. The programme has been developed using Python 3 + Node v13 and the servers run on GCP.
