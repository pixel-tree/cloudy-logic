“What am I looking at?” You might ask yourself.
The Hubble Extreme Deep Field. Produced in 2012 after twenty-two days of exposure time, this infamous sight is the result of combining thousands of individual measurements into one image.
This is the deepest visible light image ever made of the universe. In fact, you are looking back in time and, literally, staring at billions of years of cosmic history: a two-dimensional tapestry of previously untold stories; of otherwise ephemeral narratives immortalised here in pixels.
Indeed, most of these objects will no longer exist as they appear. Many will have burned out, their matter decaying over millions of years and, subsequently, becoming devoid of all visible structure.
Due to our cosmic insignificance, such inconveniences might not be at the forefront of our conscious minds in prosaic day-to-day contexts: we are able to interact and socialise in real time; albeit information is physical, governed by the physical laws of the universe.
Therefore, the transmission of information is strictly at the mercy of its mediation and, although this is often imperceptible in the post-digital world, we may experience these limitations first-hand as latency—simply by browsing the internet and waiting for some content to load.
Another way to conceptualise this is to stand outside and gaze outward into the sky. It takes just over a second for moonlight to hit our eyes, meaning we could establish communications between here and there rather effortlessly; but over eight minutes for sunlight to reach us, meaning that each round of call-and-response requires at least sixteen minutes. If one witnessed an elaborate solar event, it would have actually happened some time ago.
Thanks to modern imaging technologies we have access to unique realms of information beyond our senses (e.g. using infrared to see past optical wavelengths). However, this implies something metaphysically profound: an image such as the above is a reconstruction—a translation of data for our sensory spectrum rather than something purely phenomenal; and thus, a mere approximation based on our current knowledge and understanding of the material world. In this case, a representation of the Fornax constellation, captured by the Hubble apparatus and interpreted by a wide array of instrumentation (a mixture of computers and humans).
