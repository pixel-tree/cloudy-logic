Cloudy Logic is a piece of philosophical writing and a multimedia artwork hosted online, made up of several narratives that broadly contemplate representations, knowledge and the nature of reality. It is inspired by an article of the same name (James, 2015), in which parallels are made between machine learning and pseudo-rational practices such as astrological forecasting: essentially, masquerading superstitions in empirical terms to make them seem more credible.
Most machine learning systems may be broken down into three main components: data representation (how information is fed into the network), objective function (a way to represent the problem) and optimisation method (the means to achieve our objective). Bias, in this context, is often associated with its negative connotations (e.g. racial bias) or in a more technical sense with underfitting (i.e. failure to capture underlying patterns in the data). The mainstream conversation rarely addresses (inductive) bias for its utility, as the necessary evil: assumptions help learning algorithms distinguish signal from noise (further reading: priors). 
Developed in response to conversations with various experts and nonexperts about interpretability in AI, the core idea behind the featured stories is to consider bias in the context of knowledge production, because, without specificity it is merely reduced to rhetoricâ€”a scapegoat for a more expansive problem.
