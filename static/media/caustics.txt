Throughout human history, representations of time and space have emerged in various forms: linguistic abstraction, symbols and mathematical logic; expressed through the spoken word, in gestures, as sounds, visual art and material objects. Innovations in storage media have not only enabled the preservation of stories and novel means of their communication but also empowered us as learners: allowing us to record events in the natural world, model complex phenomena, and interface with systems of knowledge through the twenty-first century looking glass (interconnected computer networks, i.e., the internet).
Take for example the RGB colour system, in which the three primary additive colours, red, green and blue, are added together to reproduce more than sixteen million unique combinations (with a value 0-255 for each individual channel). This model is arguably the most well-known to represent colour in digital media; and although it has become ubiquitous in the context of computing technologies its roots are firmly grounded in nineteenth century physics research. Without the seminal work done to understand light and vision we would be unable to represent the natural world in this level of detail.
Similarly, based on our current understanding of the universe (matter, energy, mathematics, etc.) we are able to simulate caustic networks: reflections and refractions, the manifestations of which depend on material properties such as composition, density, transparency and reflectance, among others, as well as the environment in which the objects exist.
Despite lacking the resources to achieve a flawless level of accuracy in replicating the phenomenon, the basic principles can be represented in lower resolution: materials diffuse light differently and changes in wavelength (i.e. hue) affect the angle of refraction (how light travels through an object). It may be hard to distinguish nuances between the three images at this scale; but when combined something familiar emerges.
